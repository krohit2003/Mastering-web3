In this problem we create two car  objects  that have different speed and coordinates we then call the methods such as accelerate,break, so their speed changes 
and updates their coordinates bsed on their current speed then the method detect collision is call to check if the cars will collide or not and calculate the time of collision 
after that we print the  output in console
